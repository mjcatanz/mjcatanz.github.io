Here is a list of software and code I have worked on.

### pyscapes

#### Persistence Landscapes in python

`pyscapes` is a package written by Gabby Angeloro and myself as part of her master's thesis for working with persistence landscapes in python. Persistence Landscapes are a stable feature maps for persistence diagrams. There are exact and approximate methods implemented, together with arithmetic and visualization methods. The code is currently in the process of being incorporated into scikit-tda.

The code is available [here](https://github.com/gabbyangeloro/Pyscapes)

### fpmods

#### Finitely presented modules over the Steenrod algebra

`fpmods` is a sage package I wrote as part of my master's thesis for working
with modules over the Steenrod algebra. To keep all of the computations exact, we restrict to only finitely presented modules over the Steenrod algebra. Each such module is defined over a finite sub-Hopf algebra where finite computations can be carried out and then tensored up to the full Steenrod algebra. The code is currently in the process of being incorporated into sage. 

The code is available [here](https://github.com/rrbruner/FPMods)
