I am a mathematician interested in the interplay between topology, geometry, physics, and data science. Specifically, I work on projects involving theoretical and applied Topological Data Analysis with an eye towards machine learning. I am also interested in stochastic currents, and other applications and manifestations of mathematical physics.
